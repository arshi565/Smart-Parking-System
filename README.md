# Smart-Parking-System
The increase in commercial centres in metropolitan cities has led to heavy traffic due to overcrowding. There arenâ€™t sufficient parking spaces in every commercial building. Due to various population hotspots in the cities, there is a shortage of parking space. Which in turn compels people to look out for alternate inappropriate places such as roads to park their automobiles, hindering the entire traffic flow as well as wasting their time in pursuit  of finding the parking place. Moreover, if a parking place is full, there is no way that the user can know the estimated time before the next parking slot will be empty or nearby any other vacant parking is available. The purpose of this document is to build an online smart parking system that provides users with vacant parking spaces nearby. Hence this overcomes the problem of inappropriate parking.
